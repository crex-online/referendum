# Direct democracy

# TODO

* [mysql schema](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/?keyword=dd_tyhou) 
* polling/voting system STV?
* Code based unit testing


Main sections:

* Polls(Dynamic polls)
* Discussions(reddit style or disqus)
* Collaborative documents(git with forking/branching)


What is decided by poll makers?

* The question, or the poll title/text
* The # of winners
* The poll algorithm? (Always ranked though)


What is hardcoded?

* Categories, or custom subreddit/forum/community style?
* Or allow multiple custom tags?


Research areas:


Sites: 

* Model voting off of http://demochoice.org/


An IP based user system(IE, no logins initially)
Should the polls be title/description based? And the choices?
Should the choices have embedded discussions too?
Should there be a limited # of choices?
Should there be any moderation(always community of course) of choices or comments?

Quotes: 


> Democratic theorists have identified a trilemma due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once. These three characteristics are participation – widespread participation in the decision making process by the people affected; deliberation – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and equality – all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. Empirical evidence from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making.[9][24][25] The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.[26]

* Agreement Seeking: A consensus decision making process attempts to generate as much agreement as possible.[2]
* Collaborative: Participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible.[3]
* Cooperative: Participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences.
* Egalitarian: All members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded, as much as possibequal input into*  the process. All members have the opportunity to present, and amend proposals.
* Inclusive: As many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process.
* Participatory: The consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers.[4]


Discussion should be presented **before** voting.
